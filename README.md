# Holidaymaker
small travel-company app project (built with SQL database and Java)

* Added possibility to display bookings (all at once, or by specific guest).
* Added possibility to display all registered guests in systems.
* added price calculations (if extra bed is chosen or if half/full-board is added)
* Added all features required to get G/VG-grade (at least according to me).
* Repetitive code: couldn't figure out hot to create a method to reuse all PreparedStatments, and ResultSets.
* Been testing for a good while. Everything seems to work correctly (there could still be many mistakes, though.).
* Many methods are quite long (due to the fact that I couldn't create reusable methods for some things)
* All guests in database have lowercase letters in first_name and last_name.
This because of Java code - now you can enter names in console with lowercase, uppercase
or both.
* Also added SQL diagram in SQL folder on github, so you can see how i thought when i created
MySQL database structure.
* Biggest issue I've had in the end is that i cannot skip asset_profile
